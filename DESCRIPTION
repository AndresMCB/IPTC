Description: PTC package provides tools find miRNA-mRNA causal regulatory relationships during 
 biological processes. Causal inference is made by assuming a linear dependence model between 
 the predictors (miRNAs) and a target mRNA (response variable). This model is assumed invariant 
 throughout the whole process. 
 The model is created from gene expression sequential data. PTC transforms static gene expression 
 datasets to sequential data (via a Pseudotime analysis). PTC identifies causal regulatory 
 relationships by testing violations to the invariance property (Peters et al., 2015; Pfister et 
 al., 2018) for those sets that contains only miRNAs that biologically can interact with each target gene.
